**Introduction**

So what exactly is a full-stack developer, why would anyone want to describe themselves as such and why would an organisation wish to hire such a person?

**Origin**

The origin of the term "full-stack developer" is unclear.  It probably originated during the Web 2.0 era and took hold with the (possibly apocryphal) Facebook policy of only hiring "full-stack" developers.

----------

**What is the Stack ?**

To many, the Stack originally meant LAMP, based on the open source components of Linux, Apache Web Server, MySQL and PHP.  Javascript web-developers may talk of the MEAN stack, comprising of MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js.  One could also refer to a generic software stack, possibly where one or more of the four original components are replaced with alternatives, including ones provided by a Cloud based software service.

One could also break down a more abstract *Stack* concept into User Interface, User Experience, Design, Business Logic, Data Model, Security, Network, Storage and Hosting.  User Interface could further be broken down by device type - desktop, mobile or "things" (IoT enabled devices).  Network, storage and hosting could also be broken down into where and how those things are provided (hosted, co-located, cloud enabled etc.)

**What is a full-stack developer?**

Thinking about the definition from the previous section, the Stack appears a huge, complex and evolving concept.  Perhaps it is hubris to even claim to be a full-stack developer?  I call myself one, so what do I actually mean?

A full-stack developer is one who can demonstrate both *deep* and *shallow* understanding of the various components that make up an application.  

They will demonstrate deep knowledge of at least one development language (for me, Javascript) and shallow knowledge of others (Java, PHP, Ruby, C# in my case)

They will demonstrate shallow understanding of a number of databases but a deep understanding of the architectural processes around deciding whether a database is required and what type (NoSQL vs relational)

They will demonstrate a deep understanding of the HTTP Protocol/REST and shallow knowledge of Service Oriented Architecture, they will have a deep understanding of more than one authentication mechanism, they will have shallow understanding of different caching strategies and services (memcached, redis etc.)

They will have a deep understanding of device specific issues (browser for a developer predominantly concerned with web, devices for a native/mobile developer) and shallow understanding of UI/UX design patterns and how they can be implemented on those devices.

They will have a deep understanding of at least one Infrastructure/Platform as a Service offering (AWS, Azure, Heroku) and shallow understanding of others.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, they will have a willingness to learn and acquire new skills and a curiosity around the professional world they live and work in.

**Processes and Tools**

How a full-stack developer works is also important.  They should know one source code management tool inside out (probably Git) and be comfortable with code reviews/pull requests and determining branching strategies.  They should understand Test / Behaviour Driven Development processes.  They should have a deep understanding of Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery and at least one CI/CD tool (Jenkins, Travis-CI etc.) They should have a deep understanding of Agile development.

----------

**Closing Thoughts**

A full-stack developer is not a polyglot programmer, neither are they someone with a complete understanding of everything they touch.  Rather, they should be able to reconcile a portfolio of expertise and specialisms with a broad understanding of how to implement end to end solutions.  The should have the humility to admit what they do not know and the willingness to acquire new skills and expertise.
