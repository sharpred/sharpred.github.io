**Introduction**

Where to begin? I guess a lot of people struggle with this.  Good writing is _hard_ and getting going somehow seems the hardest thing of all. I have had many short lived attempts to write blogs in the past and these efforts never seem to last.  Maybe this time will be different....

**Motivation**

I am a goal orientated person, I do not like doing things as a matter of routine, or just _because_. I need a reason to do something, so I figured that writing a book might be a good way to motivate me to write regularily.  I have been here before though, in 2017 I had an abortive attempt at writing a book on React Native. I stopped for a variety of reasons, I got offered some paid work that was hard to turn down and took up some of my writing time, I was struggling with the content and decided that, actually, I did not actually like using React Native all that much anyway, so writing a book on it seemed absurd.  I decided just to stop.
